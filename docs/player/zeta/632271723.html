<br/>These are the zetas you are missing from important toons (e.g. not Farmboy) that you have at G8 or higher and are sorted by popularity among people who have the character geared.  The first one is popularity within the BRG Alliance.  Higher scores are better zetas, at least in theory -- this does <b>not</b> consider your team makeup aside from a few simple rules on leadership zetas.  These are merely guidelines.<table id="zetas"><thead><tr><th>Toon</th><th>Stats</th><th>Zeta</th><th>Description</th><th title="Popularity among players">Popularity</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td><img class="toI" src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/textures/tex.charui_grandinquisitor.png" /></td><td data-order="37771">zzGrand Inquisitor, 37k</td><td><img src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/textures/tex.abilityui_passive_compassionleavesatrail.png" style="width: 30px" /> Compassion Leaves a Trail</td><td>For each Inquisitorius ally, enemies with Purge have -10% Defense and -5 Speed.\n\nIf an enemy evades an Inquisitorius ally's attack, all other enemies take true damage and dispel Foresight from themselves.\n\nThe first time each enemy reaches 6 stacks of Purge, Grand Inquisitor takes a bonus turn and gains 10% Critical Avoidance, Health Steal, and Offense and 5 Speed until the end of the encounter (stacking, max 6). These bonuses are doubled if the enemy is Jedi.\n\nWhile in Territory Wars: Whenever Jedi enemies with Purge gain Protection Up, they take damage equal to 25% of their Max Health at the end of that turn. This damage can't defeat enemies. If an enemy with 6 stacks of Purge were to reduce Grand Inquisitor to 1% Health, he recovers 100% Health and Protection (limit once per enemy).</td><td>26</td></tr>
<tr><td><img class="toI" src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/textures/tex.charui_admiraltrench.png" /></td><td data-order="33628">zzAdmiral Trench, 33k</td><td><img src="https://game-assets.swgoh.gg/textures/tex.abilityui_passive_faction_separatist.png" style="width: 30px" /> I Smell Fear, and It Smells Good</td><td>At the start of battle, Admiral Trench loses 50% Max Health and gains that much Max Protection. While Trench is active, Separatist allies have +50% Potency. At the start of his turn, he gains a Protection Over Time (10%) for 2 turns. While Trench has Protection Up, he is immune to Buff Immunity and Healing Immunity.\n\nThe first time each enemy loses all Protection, at the end of that turn they are Feared for 1 turn which can't be dispelled, evaded, or resisted.\n\nWhenever another non-Droid Separatist ally is damaged by an attack, defeated, or evades, Trench has a 50% chance to gain 100% Turn Meter (limit once per turn). Whenever an enemy dispels Protection Up from Trench, they are inflicted with Shock for 2 turns which can't be evaded or resisted.\n\nWhile in Territory Wars: Whenever an enemy resists a debuff from a Separatist ally, they lose 10% Critical Damage (stacking) and 10% Tenacity (stacking) for 3 turns. The first time Trench's Health is reduced below 75%, he recovers 100% Health and gains Foresight, Protection Up (50%), and Tenacity Up for 2 turns. While a Separatist ally has a Heal Over Time, Health recovery on them is increased by 15%. While a Separatist ally has a Protection Over Time, Protection recovery on them is increased by 15%.\n\nAllies with Tactical Supremacy have +25 Speed.</td><td>19</td></tr>

Whenever an ally is critically hit they and Cal recover 5% Health and Protection. If the ally is also a Light or Dark Side Unaligned Force User they and Cal gain Protection Up (10%, stacking, max 50%) for 2 turns.\n\nFor each Special ability used by each other character, Cal gains a stack of Persistence, which can't be copied, dispelled, or prevented. If an opponent takes the first turn in an encounter, Cal gains 15 stacks of Persistence.\n\nPersistence: At the start of his turn, Cal does the following based on the number of stacks of Persistence that he has:\n\n- 10+ stacks: He and all Unaligned Force User allies gain Foresight for 2 turns\n- 20+ stacks: He and all Unaligned Force User allies gain Defense Up and Protection Up (30%) for 2 turns\n- 30 stacks: He inflicts Ability Block and Buff Immunity on all enemies for 2 turns, which can't be evaded or resisted, and all allies gain 50% Turn Meter, this effect is doubled for Light Side Unaligned Force Users; stacks of Persistence are reset\n\nWhile in Territory Wars and if there is an ally Ahsoka Tano (Fulcrum) with an upgraded Omicron: Ahsoka's solo Omicron effects are no longer disabled when she has allies; this effect persists through defeat.</td><td>12</td></tr>
