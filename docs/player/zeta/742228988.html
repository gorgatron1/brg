<br/>These are the zetas you are missing from important toons (e.g. not Farmboy) that you have at G8 or higher and are sorted by popularity among people who have the character geared.  The first one is popularity within the BRG Alliance.  Higher scores are better zetas, at least in theory -- this does <b>not</b> consider your team makeup aside from a few simple rules on leadership zetas.  These are merely guidelines.<table id="zetas"><thead><tr><th>Toon</th><th>Stats</th><th>Zeta</th><th>Description</th><th title="Popularity among players">Popularity</th></tr></thead>

At the end of each turn, Tusken allies gain 20% Defense and Tenacity for each stack of Momentum on them until the end of the next turn.\n\nWhenever a Tusken ally is targeted by an enemy and they have at least 10 stacks of Momentum, remove all stacks of Momentum, Stun all attacking enemies for 1 turn, which can't be resisted, and the targeted Tusken ally takes a bonus turn. For each stack of Momentum removed this way, there is a 20% chance (+5% per Relic Amplifier level, max 50% total) to inflict a stack of Damage Over Time on each attacking enemy for 2 turns.\n\nWhile in 3v3 Grand Arenas: Boba Fett, Scion of Jango counts as a Tusken ally if there is no character that summons at the start of battle. Boba Fett, Scion of Jango's Payout is active and he can't lose Momentum stacks except through expiration.</td><td>10</td></tr>
