Team: Shaak, ARC, 501st Echo, Rex, Fives

<p>
<b>NOTE: this requires the Devour to be used to trigger Fives.</b>

<p>
This team can be used on P2 or P3 but P2 is preferred.

<p>
<b>How it works:</b> This team intentionally lets Randy eat someone other than Shaak Ti or Fives, so that Fives gives stats to the other clones. The extra boost of speed lets Rex get out two Aerial Advantage attacks, which accounts for the bulk of the team's damage.

<p>
<b>Strategy:</b> Use only basic attacks until Randy eats someone. If he chomps Shaak Ti or Fives (i.e. no Fives sacrifice gets triggered), retreat and try again. Delay dropping the door as long as possible, to give time for Rex to use first Aerial Advantage.
<ul>
<li>Shaak Ti can basic the door panel once without dropping; doing this as her first move prevents feeding TM to Randy and makes it more likely to get first Aerial Advantage before door drop.
<li>Use Shaak Ti Assault Team special only in topple, to prevent feeding turn meter. Target Rex, to give Speed Up buff, and ensure getting to second Aerial Advantage.
<li>Use Shaak Ti Training Exercises special whenever needed to heal a clone in yellow health.
<li>Save Echo EMP Grenade to drop the door. After, use it whenever available, as it does more damage than his basic.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Mods:</b> Typical mods for this team should be OK, but optimizing may be needed if your team has trouble getting to the second Aerial Advantage and getting to the 5% mark. Priorities are in order listed below:
<ul>
<li>Fives optimally is as fast as you can manage; Speed and Health sets, Speed arrow, Offense triangle and cross, Health circle. Tiebreaker secondaries for roughly equivalent speed mods are flat and percent Offense, Health, and Protection, in that order.
<li>Rex gets your absolute fastest speed secondaries. Use Speed and Health sets, and additional Health secondaries ensure he survives long enough to get second special out.
<li>Shaak Ti should focus Health if R5, and can afford to focus Speed if R7+.
<li>Echo and ARC Trooper both go all out on Offense. The higher damage they have, the closer this team can get to 6% on the phase.
</ul><br/>
