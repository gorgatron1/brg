Team: SLKR, Daka, Zombie, Thrawn, Hux
                
<p>
This team can be used on P2 or P3 but P3 is preferred.

<p>
<b>How it works:</b> Revive mechanics from Old Daka and Nightsister Zombie helps avoid needing to send in a sacrifice R5, and delays long enough for SLKR to build up big stacks of Siphon before ending with an ultimate stance and some last big hits. Multiple hits from Old Daka and Thrawn help build up ultimate charge. If you do not have the ultimate unlocked, this team will do significantly less damage.

<p>
<b>Strategy:</b> Use SLKR Stasis Strike ("poke") attack often, to get more stacks of Siphon built up, and to get higher Mastery from Furious Onslaught later in the battle.
<ul>
<li>If both Hux and Thrawn are fast enough, you can open the battle with two SLKR pokes, then use the AoE to drop the door. Exact speeds needed are not yet known, but it should work with Hux at 329+ and Thrawn at 328+ speed. If you can get it with lower speeds, please report so others can have an exact target to reach.
<li>Do NOT use the SLKR ultimate with less than 100% charge. Doing so will limit the total amount of Mastery gained from Siphon, and result in much lower overall damage.
<li>The first ultimate stance should do two pokes and an AoE, instead of all AoE. This will reduce the total Mastery gained from the first ultimate stance, but it will greatly scale up Siphon and result in higher overall Mastery by the end of battle.
<li>The second ultimate stance should do poke, AoE, basic. This maximizes Mastery gained, and the basic attack does the highest damage so the battle ends on the biggest possible hit.
<li>This team is set up the best for bridging the end of P1 into P2, but the coordination and multiple devices required to do so may not be feasible. All teams should go in with around 5% or less remaining in P1, and nobody should post until all report in as getting to second ultimate stance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Mods:</b> Typical mods are probably OK. Some suggested targets are listed below, if you have success with lower stats, please report to us so others developing this team have a better idea of the minimum stats needed.
<ul>
<li>SLKR wants speed, then offense. Use a Speed set, to ensure that he can get to the second ultimate stance, and add a Crit Damage triangle to boost his damage output. Target around 570 Speed.
<li>Hux should be as fast as possible, and preferably at least one speed faster than Thrawn. Target 329 Speed or better.
<li>Thrawn should be as fast as possible, and preferably at least one speed slower than Hux. Target 328 Speed or better.
<li>Old Daka should be stacked with health, while still being reasonably fast. Aim for over 120k Health and 280 Speed.
<li>Zombie is similar to Old Daka, stack with health while having some speed. Aim for over 100k Health and 240 Speed.
