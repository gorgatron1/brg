Team: Vader, Wat, BB-8 &#11088; / Shaak Ti, C-3PO, KRU

<p>
<b>How it works:</b> The Vader team is built around stacking up a lot of Damage over Time debuffs (DOTs), then maximizing spike damage from Vader's Culling Blade ability before the boss murders your entire team.

<ul>
<li>Vader lead re-applies DOTs after they expire.
<li>KRU and BB-8 apply Tenacity Down debuff on their basic, to ensure DOTs are not resisted.
<li>KRU also takes reduced damage from % Max Health attacks, and taunts, to take the bulk of the attacks for the team.
<li>Wat will assist whenever an ally with Tech uses a special ability, and applies more DOTs on this assist.
</ul>

<b>Strategy:</b> Use the team placed in exactly the order shown in the image: Vader, Wat, BB, 3PO, KRU.
<ul>
<li>Streaming runs helps to get used to how this team works faster. Ask for help until you get the hang of how the team works with your mods.
<li>The run can go bad quickly if you make a mistake. Be ready to retreat or force quit to try again.
<li>Wat gives Weapon Tech to Vader, Medpack Tech to BB, and Shield Tech to 3PO, then will only ever use basics for the rest of the run.
<li>Be sure to always target the Captain when using specials, to get extra DOTs.
<li>Target the side Guards when not adding Tenacity Down or DOTs to the Captain, to prevent feeding extra turn meter.
<li>If the Captain loses Tenacity Down, use a KRU basic, BB basic, or 3PO special ASAP to re-apply.
<li>When 3PO uses special, always call Wat to assist for double application of DOTs.
<li>Vader should use Merciless Massacre and Culling Blade early to reduce other cooldowns, but make sure both are off cooldown for the final Culling Blade! Having Merciless up boosts Vader's offense and crit damage by 50% each on the toss!
<li>Save Illuminated Destiny on BB until just before the final Culling Blade. There won't be enough time to use it twice.
<li>A good run will have between 40 and 50 DOTs stacked on the Captain at the end.
</ul>

<b>Mods:</b> On everyone except KRU, try to avoid Health primary and secondaries, to limit damage taken by the % Max Health damage the enemy abilities have.
<ul>
<li>Vader wants an Offense set, Crit Damage triangle, Offense cross, with lots of offense and speed secondaries, and a bit of crit chance. Target at least +120 speed, +2000 physical damage, and 75%+ crit chance.
<li>Wat wants a Speed set, and the fastest speed secondaries you can manage. Adding potency secondaries and a Potency set and/or cross can help land DOTs when Tenacity Down is not applied. Target at least +135 speed, more is better.
<li>BB wants a Speed set, and the fastest speed secondaries you can manage. Target at least +150 speed, more is better.
<li>3PO wants a Speed set, and the fastest speed secondaries you can manage. Add some protection secondaries to handle splash damage. Target at least +160 speed, more is better.
<li>KRU wants Health and Defense sets, with one or two Defense primaries on arrow, triangle, or cross. Target 75%+ armor and 85k+ health.
